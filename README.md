# GimpFormats

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

Forked from https://github.com/TheHeadlessSourceMan/gimpFormats

A pure python implementation of the GIMP XCF image format. Use this to interact
with GIMP image formats

Issues and contributions very much wanted/ needed 😀

## Getting started

Read an image

```python
from gimpformats.gimpXcfDocument import GimpDocument
project = GimpDocument("image.xcf")
```

Iterate the image and report the contents of each group followed by the first
level children of the image

```python
"""List data on groups followed by the direct children of a gimp xcf document
"""
layers = project.layers
index = 0
print("## Group info...")
while index < len(layers):
	layerOrGroup = layers[index]
	if layerOrGroup.isGroup:
		index += 1
		while layers[index].itemPath is not None:
			print("Group \"" + layerOrGroup.name + "\" contains Layer \"" + layers[index].name + "\"")
			layers.pop(index)
	else:
		index += 1

print("## Document direct children...")
for layerOrGroup in layers:
	print("\"" + layerOrGroup.name + "\" is a " + ("Group" if layerOrGroup.isGroup else "Layer"))

```

Example output:

```none
## Group info...
Group "Layer Group" contains Layer "Layer"
Group "Layer Group" contains Layer "Layer2"
## Document direct children...
"bg #1" is a Layer
"bg" is a Layer
"bg #2" is a Layer
"Transformation" is a Layer
"Layer Group" is a Group
"Background" is a Layer
```

## Next tasks (see below)

- Saving

## Currently supports

- Loading xcf files (up to current GIMP version 2.10)
- Getting image hierarchy and info
- Getting image for each layer (PIL image)
- .gbr brushes
- .vbr brushes
- .gpl palette files
- .pat pattern files
- .gtp tool presets
- Generate a flattened image
- Add new layers

## In progress but results in crashes and tests failing

- Saving
- .ggr gradients - reads/saves fine, but I need to come up with a way to get the
actual colours
- .gih brush sets - BUG: seems to have more image data per brush than what's
expected
- .gpb brush - should work, but I need some test files

## Not implemented

- Exported paths in .svg format. - Reading should be easy enough, but I need to
ensure I don't get a full-blown svg in the mix
- Standard "parasites"

## Documentation

A high-level overview of how the documentation is organized organized will help you know
where to look for certain things:

<!--
- [Tutorials](/documentation/tutorials) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get
  started using the software. Start here if you’re new.
-->
- The [Technical Reference](/documentation/reference) documents APIs and other aspects of the
  machinery. This documentation describes how to use the classes and functions at a lower level
  and assume that you have a good high-level understanding of the software.
<!--
- The [Help](/documentation/help) guide provides a starting point and outlines common issues that you
  may have.
-->

## Install With PIP

```python
pip install gimpformats
```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/gimpformats/ for more info

## Language information

### Built for

This program has been written for Python versions 3.8 - 3.11 and has been tested with both 3.8 and
3.11

## Install Python on Windows

### Chocolatey

```powershell
choco install python
```

### Windows - Python.org

To install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the latest
version.

## Install Python on Linux

### Apt

```bash
sudo apt install python3.x
```

### Dnf

```bash
sudo dnf install python3.x
```

## Install Python on MacOS

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install python@3.x
```

### MacOS - Python.org

To install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ and download the latest
version.

## How to run

### Windows

- Module
	`py -3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)

- File
	`py -3.x [file]` or `./[file]`

### Linux/ MacOS

- Module
	`python3.x -m [module]` or `[module]` (if module installs a script)

- File
	`python3.x [file]` or `./[file]`

## Building

This project uses https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/FHMake to automate most of the building. This
command generates the documentation, updates the requirements.txt and builds the library artefacts

Note the functionality provided by fhmake can be approximated by the following

```sh
handsdown  --cleanup -o documentation/reference
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with dev --output requirements_optional.txt
poetry build
```

`fhmake audit` can be run to perform additional checks

## Testing

For testing with the version of python used by poetry use

```sh
poetry run pytest
```

Alternatively use `tox` to run tests over python 3.8 - 3.11

```sh
tox
```
