# GimpFormats

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

Forked from https://github.com/TheHeadlessSourceMan/gimpFormats

A pure python implementation of the GIMP XCF image format.

Use this to interact with GIMP image formats

Issues and contributions very much wanted/ needed :smile:

## Getting started

Read an image
```python
from gimpformats_unofficial.gimpXcfDocument import GimpDocument
project = GimpDocument("image.xcf")
```

Iterate the image and report the contents of each group followed by the first
level children of the image
```python
layers = project.layers
index = 0
while index < len(layers):
	layerOrGroup = layers[index]
	if layerOrGroup.isGroup:
		index += 1
		while layers[index].itemPath is not None:
			print("Group " + layerOrGroup.name + " contains Layer " + layers[index].name)
			layers.pop(index)
	else:
		index += 1

for layerOrGroup in layers:
	print(layerOrGroup.name + " is a " + ("Group" if layerOrGroup.isGroup else "Layer"))
```

Example output:

```none
Group Layer Group contains Layer Layer
Group Layer Group contains Layer Layer2
bg #1 is a Layer
bg is a Layer
bg #2 is a Layer
Transformation is a Layer
Layer Group is a Group
Background is a Layer
```

## Next tasks (see below)
- Generate a flattened image
- Add new layers

## Currently supports

- Loading xcf files (up to current GIMP version 2.10)
- Getting image hierarchy and info
- Getting image for each layer (PIL image)
- .gbr brushes
- .vbr brushes
- .gpl palette files
- .pat pattern files
- .gtp tool presets

## In progress but results in crashes and tests failing
- Saving
- Alter documents (add layer, etc)
- .ggr gradients - reads/saves fine, but I need to come up with a way to get the
- actual colours
- .gih brush sets - BUG: seems to have more image data per brush than what's
- expected
- .gpb brush - should work, but I need some test files

## Not implemented
- Rendering a final, compositied image
- Exported paths in .svg format. - Reading should be easy enough, but I need to ensure I don't get a full-blown svg in the mix
- Standard "parasites"

## Install With PIP

```python
pip install gimpformats_unofficial
```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/gimpformats_unofficial/ for more info

## Language information
### Built for
This program has been written for Python 3 and has been tested with
